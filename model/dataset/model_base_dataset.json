And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever!"}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "Yes. I have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot.

I have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. What are some things you do to deal with depression?"}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won't get so bad that I can't remember what it felt like to be a bit happy. "}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "That sounds like some good advice. I think I will try to find a good podcast or a good comedy series that I like and spend time doing that.

"}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "I wish that I could listen to more....this thing is so slow. Remember, we 're all in this together, and we will come out the other end.

I live in the country so I can go for nice walks when the weather is nice. Staying safe is definitely important right now."}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "Oh...it's fortunate that you live in the country. Can you take some deep breathes and watch the trees, the animals, and nature....they are all here for us???"}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "Yes that is exactly what I do. Thank you so much for your help today. You have made me feel better just having someone to vent to."}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "Keep venting, if it makes you feel better. I know I do when I can talk to someone I don't know. Is it nice where you are today, so that you can look at something bigger than the indoors?? That often helps me feel better."}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "Yes. It the weather is very pretty here today. As a matter of fact, I think I am fixing to go for a nice walk. I hope you have a wonderful day and thank you for listening.

The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?"}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "I have encouraged my friends to block them as well, but a new account always pops up.

It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue. Do you think that might help?"}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "I think that is an excellent idea! That is a good way to end this once and for all. "}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "I sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control over how you are able to interact with people. I wish you the best in dealing with this and hope you begin to feel better about it soon, especially entering into a new year! "}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "Thank you very much! "}]}

Is that something you can do?"}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "But i can't tell this to them because they also become sad when they know about this"}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "Okay, I understand.

I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?"}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "In about a month. "}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.

I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her. "}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track."}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually."}, {"from": "seeker", "value": "That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper. "}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week."}, {"from": "supporter", "value": "Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me.
